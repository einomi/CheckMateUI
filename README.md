# CheckMateUI ☑️

Welcome to CheckMateUI, your robust tool for comprehensive UI manual testing. This adaptable framework is tailored to meet your specific needs and works seamlessly with the Kanban method.

**Note:** Items marked with the 🔃 symbol denote areas that require regular regression checks, helping to ensure that your UI stays up-to-date and flawless. Items without the symbol are considered as one-time tasks.

CheckMateUI is your strategic ally in the chess game of UI testing - delivering a checkmate that leaves no room for errors!

## Table of Contents

**Important** Consider priority just as an order of execution. For example, there is no point in checking all links if the page is under development (because we may not have all final URLs for links), it is better to check the layout and the main functionality first. This is why the tasks are divided into priority groups.
    
- [1st priority tasks](#1st-priority-tasks)
- [2nd priority tasks](#2nd-priority-tasks)
- [3rd priority tasks](#3rd-priority-tasks)
- [4th priority tasks](#4th-priority-tasks)

## 1st priority tasks

These tasks are the most important and should be completed first. They are going to be the foundation of our UI testing strategy.

✅ 🔃 Review project requirements and documentation. Explore UI designs in Figma, Adobe XD, etc.
- ✅ Explore project features based on designs, requirements, and documentation
- ✅ Study small decorative details from design mockups (if this help in future testing) 
- ✅ Learn how the layout changes when rebuilding on other screen resolutions (tablets, mobile and wide screens, if any)
- ✅ Ask questions to designers and product managers, if you have any doubts about some points

## 2nd priority tasks

These tasks are related to pixel-perfect markup checking. They are the next step in our UI testing strategy.

- ✅ 🔃 [desktop] Pixel-perfect markup checking
- ✅ 🔃 [tablet] Pixel-perfect markup checking
- ✅ 🔃 [mobile] Pixel-perfect markup checking
    
## 3rd priority tasks

✅ 🔃 Checking interactive elements (popups, sliders, carousels, etc.).
